Project Title: Fetching and dispaying users


 Overview of the project
 
 This application allows users to  manage user information. With this app, you can fetch, add, edit, and delete user details.
Fetching Users: The app fetches a list of users from an external API, displaying key details such as name, username, email, phone number, company name and street.

Adding Users: You can easily add new users using a form. Enter the required details and click "Add User" to see the new user seamlessly added to the list.

Deleting Users: Each user entry has a delete button. A simple click removes the user, instantly updating the list without needing a page reload.

Updating User Information: Edit buttons next to each user entry open a modal or separate page where you can update user details. Your changes are saved via a PUT request, and the updated info is displayed without page refresh.
